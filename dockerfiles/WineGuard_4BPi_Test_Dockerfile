# These "per-architecture" images were suggested by IBM Edge Computing
# team for 64-bit and 32-bit Raspberry Pis.
# IIRC, the 32-bit version OS are the different version of Raspbian OS.
# The 64-bit OS are based on the Rasbperry Pi OS that was
# recently published.
# The other 64-bit alternative is Ubuntu (https://hub.docker.com/r/arm64v8/ubuntu/)
