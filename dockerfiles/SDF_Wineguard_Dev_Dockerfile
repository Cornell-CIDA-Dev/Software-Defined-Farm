# NOTE: The dev image does not copy the code
# This enables making changes while testing in the same container
# The only two inconveniences are:
# (1) the working directory for the container cannot be set to wineguard
# because it is mounted when the container is created and/or run
# (2) The sdf package has to be reinstalled in edit mode
# (i.e. pip install -e .) every time the image is rebuilt
# and/or the container is recreated.

# Run the sleep command for testing
CMD ["sleep", "1h"]
