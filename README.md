# Software-Defined-Farm 

### Research Abstract
The overarching thesis of the research is: how do we feed 10 billion people in
2050 in a __*sustainable*__ manner? That is, as arable lands becomes more scarce
with threats such as climate change, how can we feed a growing global population
while keeping the planet sustainable for all living creatures.
This interdisciplinary initiative brings together Cornell researchers from
engineering, life, social, and agricultural sciences to solve the most pressing
questions facing agri-food systems. You can learn more through the below related
projects/research centers:

### About the repository
This open source repository hosts projects and ideas from the __Software-Defined
Farm (SDF) Working Group__, where the focus is building computing systems that
complement the work of farmers, both small and industrial, in their quest to be
profitable while maximizing sustainability efforts. The SDF provides an extensible
abstraction for various CIDA projects.

#### Dealing with line endings on different systems

A good rule of thumb if you experience issues:

```
git config --local core.safecrlf false
git config --local core.autocrlf true
git config --local core.autocrlf true
```

(Optionally replace `--local` with `--global` to make this the default for all of
your repositories.)
